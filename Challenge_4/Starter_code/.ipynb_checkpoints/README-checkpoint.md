Challenge 4 - Analyzing Risk and Return

The final goal of this challenge was to identify which portfolio to include in my firm's offerings
    -Berkshire
    -Tiger
    -Soros
    -Paulson
In the process of finding out the optimal portfolio to include we compared each funds performance with the S&P 500 Benchmark. We calculated:
    -Standard Deviation
    -Variance
    -Covariance
    -Beta
    -Sharpe Ratio
    
We annualized returns, and included rolling windows for the data.

Ultimately, the portfolio with the largest Sharpe Ratio , Berkshire, was chosen.
